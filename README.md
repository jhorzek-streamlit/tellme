# tellme

How to get the project:

1. Download the desktop version of GitHub (this is the easiest way)
2. Open the GitHub desktop app and log in
3. Open the project on GitHub (https://github.com/jhorzek/tellme)
4. Download the project by clicking on Code > Open with GitHub Desktop
5. Open the folder you just downloaded with your editor of choice (e.g., VSCode)

Now that we have the project locally, we have to install all dependencies

1. Create a new virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`
2. activate the virtual environment
    - on windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    - on macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. install poetry: `pip install poetry`
4. install dependencies: `poetry install`

You can now run the scripts.
