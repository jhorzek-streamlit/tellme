Create a short, engaging podcast transcript between two hosts based on the article below. 
The podcast should feel conversational and friendly, with natural back-and-forth dialogue. 
Keep the total transcript to around 3 minutes in length (approximately 400–450 words).
Make sure to stay very close to the article in terms of content. Do not add more details
that are not mentioned in the article!

## Hosts:

- Sofia (she/her) – Sofia is the explainer. She is thoughtful, confident, and good at breaking down complex ideas into simple, relatable insights. She drives the conversation by summarizing key points from the article and introducing new facts. Her tone is warm and informed, with a natural flow.
- Mark (he/him) – Mark is reactive and expressive. He brings personality and humor to the conversation. He asks questions, offers reactions, and shares personal or broader reflections on the topic. His tone is light, curious, and slightly irreverent.

## Goals:

- Summarize and discuss the article in an engaging, natural-sounding conversation.
- Rephrase content from the article in your own words—no direct quotes.
- Include one surprising or standout fact, twist, or insight from the article.
- Use a conversational, relaxed tone and keep responses short (2–3 sentences per turn).
- End with a brief reflection, question, or takeaway for the listener.
- Stay within the 3-minute time limit (about 400–450 words total).

## Structure:

### Intro (15–20 seconds)
